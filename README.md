Flask & Reactjs
===============

# What is this?

This project is for create the structure of a new application with the following architecture.
My personal goal is understand and apply the test driven development process.
I want to develop web applications that send the complete html document only a few times, and use AJAX to
build the User eXperience.

## Backend
- Flask as html provider and api backend
- Flask-SQLAlchemy to store relational models
- Flask-Security-Fork to complete the basic authentication (hoping thath in a short time it merges with Flask-Security)
- Pytest

## Frontend

- ReactJS as user interface
- React-router
- Semantic-UI-React to make it nice
- webpack to build the scripts
- (Something for test?)

# Why did you do this in this way?

I found that there are many ways to do the same. I'm gonna publish here some websites that help me to understand different structures. If you think that there is a better way, please let me know.
